# Chicken Game

This project was my object-oriented course project that I did it on my own. In this game assessment, we try to do a
simple 2-D game that will be played by the keyboard. A chicken will fall vertically while trying to avoid cats randomly
waiting on its path with an open mouth. During this journey, the chicken aims to hit targets appearing left and right
sides of its path randomly by using its golden eggs. The eggs will be launched by its mouth. Once a target is hit, the
player will get points according to the size of the target.
